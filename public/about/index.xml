      <description>Hello, my name is Pooja Sethiya. I’m genomics data analyst with profound experience in analysis of fungal genomics data. I use R, Rmarkdown and statistical tools to analyze and visualize data. Currently, I am Ph.D. candidate at University of Macau, Macau where I have worked on RNASeq, ChIPSeq, and integrated analysis of genomics data. I always seek for novel approaches to gain biological insights.
I have keen interest in learning advanced R and developing tools and packages in R for their handy and customizable use.</description>
