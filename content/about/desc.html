<p>Hello, my name is Pooja Sethiya. I’m genomics data analyst with profound experience in analysis of fungal genomics data. I use R, Rmarkdown and statistical tools to analyze and visualize data. Currently, I am Ph.D. candidate at University of Macau, Macau where I have worked on <a href="https://github.com/sethiyap/Cg_oxidative_stress/blob/master/CgOxidativeStressPaper.md">RNASeq</a>, <a href="https://sethiyap.github.io/FungalSporeAnalysis/">ChIPSeq</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sethiyap/FungalTranscriptStability">integrated analysis</a> of genomics data. I always seek for novel approaches to gain biological insights.</p>
<p>I have keen interest in learning advanced R and developing <a href="https://sethiyap.github.io/fastaR/">tools and packages</a> in R for their handy and customizable use. I strongly believe in reproducible research and hence for majority of my work I have prepared <a href="https://sethiyap.github.io/FungalSporeAnalysis/articles/pkgdown.html">reports and summary</a> using R-markdown.</p>
<p>Browse my list of <a href="https://github.com/sethiyap">projects</a> or review my full curriculum vitae <a href="img/SethiyaCurriculum_Vitae_2021_forWebsite.pdf">(resume)</a>.</p>
